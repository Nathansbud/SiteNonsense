# Nonsense: Site Edition

Not sure how standard this is, but I've found that it feels...disingenous to have a million repositories for tiny projects (if they can even be called that). GitHub pages is lovely for hosting little 5 minute projects, but some of these lovely one-and-done beasts don't need a place of their own to shine. Thus, like I've done with Java Nonsense, I think it's best to confine some of these, well, here, and leave the big projects their time to shine.

Anyhow, the [main page](index.html) should house links to each of the mini-projects (again, projects in air quotes)!
