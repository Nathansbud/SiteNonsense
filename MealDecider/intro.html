    <h1>INEFFICIENT.</h1>
    <h2>This, dear mother, is the word I would use to describe our current system of deciding meals for the week.</h2>
    <p>Every week, we go through the same song and dance, and, mostly because I'm too lazy to expend 5 minutes of energy thinking about it, end up with a menu that is same-y.</p>
    <p>Now, wouldn't it be great if, say, there was a site that made this process slightly more efficient? If your programming-inclined child whipped one up instead of sleeping in Vietnam?</p>
    <p>Never before has deciding on a menu while being too lazy to think been so easy!</p>
