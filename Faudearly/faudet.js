poems = [`Have you ever loved a rose,
and watched her slowly bloom;
and as her petals would unfold,
you grew drunk on her perfume.
Have you ever seen her dance,
her leaves all wet with dew;
and quivered with a new romance-
the wind, he loved her too.
Have you ever longed for her,
on nights that go on and on;
for now, her face is all a blur,
like a memory kept too long.
Have you ever loved a rose,
and bled against her thorns;
and swear each night to let her go,
then love her more by dawn.
-Lang Leav`,
`Sex is the cake and love the icing on top.`,
`I think of thoughts
that cannot be,
no hand can reach
across this sea,
the seasons change
on distant shores,
from frosty skies
to sunshine blue,
as summer's touch
undresses you-
Reminding me
of all the things
I often wish,
but cannot do.`,
`The autumn sun smiled softly across the gentle waves that lapped against the old wooden pier. The lighthouse threw a morning shadow as a magpie's note rang out from the swaying trees.
Dawn's light poured through the dusty wooden blinds and washed over the white linen sheets that lay crumpled and kicked off the bed.
She lay naked, breathless and beautiful. Black hair tumbling across her pert breasts.
"I love our house," she sighs.
He stares up at the powder blue ceiling, a little dreamy and wet.
"I think this might be a good morning to make marshmallows," he replies.`,
`Lust is a lovely word and makes love
so much more interesting.`,
`A midnight scribble,
a morning sigh,
you watch the words,
curl up and die.
Madness lives
inside your head,
of poems lost,
and pages dead.
A mind possessed,
by unmade books,
unwritten lines
on empty hooks.`,
`Kisses dream of lips like yours.`,
`She rode on airplanes and fell asleep in hotel beds. Dreaming of faraway places-writing poetry with her sunset eyes.`,
`I couldn't begin to count the countless memories I've lost with each pour of the vodka bottle.
Every one washed away beneath an icy sip or six of liquid forgetfulness. A mind shot to pieces by a forever empty glass.
Yet somewhere hidden within a haze, a fog that descends with the rising sun, a hangover of you remains. Untouched by hands or salty tears that quench this morning thirst.
A fading hint of perfume lost on an empty pillow.
The stray black hair lying alone in the sink.
Your toothbrush dry and carelessly abandoned.
A photograph framed in dust and cobwebs.
Suddenly, I remember all that you were.
She was a ghost of a girl, hauntingly beautiful, wonderfully lost-breaking hearts and crying holy water tears . . .
A reminder of lips pressed hard against lips.
My hand between your legs, the little pleated skirt hitched up.
Pulling your hair and fucking you hard.
The soft moans and whispered words.
A cat purring, curled up against the tiny rose tattoo on your hip.
Waking up to that smile, the one I fell in love with when the world was just ours.
I open the bottle and shut my eyes.
A twist of fate spilling cold over a lonely glass.
A reminder to forget the forgotten again.
Another day spent slowly slipping away from you.`,
`Love and loss share the same unmade bed.`,
`I watched as you reached for the ice cream.
Standing naked, body pressed up against the humming fridge.
A wispy trail of bluish gray smoke spiraling up from a dying cigarette.
Held precariously in the other hand, ash falling to the floor.
A just-fucked wetness between your legs.
Your little smile captured in grainy black and white.
By the click of a camera.`,
`A fearsome wind
cannot compel
the weakest branch
to gladly yield.
Yet,
the faintest breath
upon your lips-
and I have fallen
against my will.`,
`Roses wear blindfolds,
Violets crack whips,
candle wax dripping,
teeth biting lips.`,
`It was a sticky cotton candy kind of day.
The sun smiling, tickled and teased by wispy white clouds.
Bright yellow butterflies danced a flowery waltz with buzzing bees, while a shadowy wave rippled across the sleepy meadow of lush green.
Its chilly touch, painting tiny goose bumps on pale, winter-kissed legs.
Your orange dress hitched up, panties kicked off, my hand exploring the wetness between your thighs.
Our lips thirsty for each other.
Two strangers lost.
In the tangled arms of unquenchable desire.
"Why are you crying?"
"I think I've just found the love of my life," she replied.`,
`Lost is a lovely place to find yourself.`,
`Imagine the possibilities,
of a question posed
by pretty knees,
kneeling.
Your eyes cast downward,
pleading,
red lips parted,
and a mouth
slowly opened.
The answer given,
a soft moan,
swallowed.`,
`We fell asleep as lovers do,
listening to the raindrops
pitter-patter on the old tin roof,
hands entwined and souls
secretly smiling.`,
`Sophia opened the pretty pink gift-wrapping paper and picked up the black velvet blindfold from inside. Attached was a note written in flowing ink, which read: Are you ready for instructions?
She collapsed onto the bed, staring up at the cracks in the ceiling, a quiet smile gently touching each blushing cheek.`,
`In soft candlelight
you came,
a pale white ghost,
stepping shy
from shadows,
coy,
slipping quietly
into a restless sleep,
where all modesty
and demure
lay discarded,
stripped naked,
by a fantasy
awakened
within a dream.`,
`We ran.
Faces flushed, bare feet sinking into wet sand, our warm breath little clouds of misty white, taken by the chilly morning air.
A single wave broke, sending frothy foam sliding across our ankles, the cold biting deep.
I couldn't catch her.
A trail of flowing red hair unfurling before me, like the tail of a kite cut free from its string.
"Okay, okay . . . you win," I shouted, slowing to an unsteady walk and stopping, hands on hips, breathing heavy.
She turned around, jogging backward, her laughter floating toward me.
"You're a wimp, that's what you are, and you owe me a hundred bucks!"
We sat.
Eyes staring out to sea, her arm wrapped around my shoulders.
"I love you," she said, kissing me on the cheek.
"I love you too," I replied.
"You know, you can forget about paying me. Keep your money."
"No, you won, fair and square. A bet's a bet and I always pay my debts," I said, my fingers gently brushing away a tangled strand of wet hair from her face.
"Ha! You don't get it, do you? It's me who should be paying you."
"I don't follow. Well, unless I'm racing you on some beach after a night of a million vodkas."
Her smiling eyes met mine.
"Do you remember when we first met? What I said to you after we fucked in the dunes, lying on our backs, smoking a joint and searching for shooting stars in the night sky?"
"Not exactly but go on . . ."
"I told you I wasn't the kind of girl who was easily caught."
"Yes, now I remember, or I think I do, I was pretty wasted."
She took my hand and pressed it to her chest. I could feel her heart racing beneath the Mickey Mouse tee.
"You have my heart," she whispered. "You have all of me."`,
`I am hopelessly in love with a memory. An echo
from another time, another place.`,
`Such pretty things
you said to me-
Unbutton me
some more.
For I am yours
to take tonight
upon this forest floor.
Let's make a bed
in autumn leaves,
and leave
no leaf unturned.
Beneath these trees
please teach me,
please-
To learn
a love
unlearned.`,
`I love the moment when your eyes close
and your lips open in slow motion.`,
`"Romance is all well and good, but . . . it's just that I am not in the mood for whispered sweet nothings or your fingers running softly through my hair. What I want, more than anything, is for you to treat me like your own personal sex doll.
"Don't kiss me-make me bite my lip."`,
`The very suggestion
of your words, she said-
bind my wrists tighter
than any rope.`,
`"Unbutton, unzip, unclip, untie, undo, undress."
"Understood," she replied.`,
`I love to watch you touch yourself,
on rainy afternoons.
The wandering hands.
The soft little moans.
Hips twitching.
Wet fingers fucking.
A solo show,
performed for one.`,
`You make me feel a little dirty, she said, and I fucking love it.`,
`I dreamt of us last night, living in the little stone cottage by the sea, the one you promised me.
Our love held together by wrinkled hands as we slowly walked across ever-sinking sands. Each languid step taking us closer toward our very last sunset.
It wasn't until I was fully awake that I truly woke up.
I suddenly realized it's no coincidence the two middle letters of life are if.
For every action we make, there is a reaction. The outcome often beyond our control, fragile and fraught with ruinous consequences. Like a soap bubble made real by a gentle breath only to be taken by it.
If you had stayed here, in my trembling arms, would our fingers not be pricked by the thorns of red roses?
And what if our love could have stood up to the storm, standing strong, like our cottage by the sea?
If only . . .`,
`She was a curious girl,
who loved the smell
of old books,
chasing butterflies,
and touching herself
under the covers.`,
`There is a quiet beauty
in a miserable gray,
with leaden skies
and brooding hue,
this gentle rain
a reminder of you,
tracing silent tears
on a windowpane.
From a changing tide
to an empty beach,
a broken wave
writes a lonely line,
a crashing metaphor
captured in time,
of a memory found
on this forgotten shore.`,
`Your smile is a beautifully written line
I hope to write some day.`,
`I cannot speak the words,
that haven't already been said.
A well-thumbed thesaurus,
gathering dust,
inside my head.`,
`I am here,
you are there,
it really is perplexing.
We cannot touch,
in real time much,
there's nothing quite as vexing.
Like sex fulfilled
in bits and bytes,
and endless late-night texting.`,
`Do you know what really turns me on?
What I find incredibly sexy? Kindness.`,
`She came from the ocean,
this wild girl from the sea,
her hair flowing southward,
she walked toward me.
A west to east smile,
with eyes steely gray,
like a storm in the distance,
rolling in from the bay.
We kissed with the sunrise,
made love when it set,
a promise by moonlight,
came dawn, my regret.
He left for the ocean,
this boy from the land,
his spirit soars northward,
his heart in her hands.`,
`Crashing waves on an empty beach,
the rhythm of our hearts,
two drowning lovers lost at sea,
my lips adrift in yours.`,
`Body framed
with arms outstretched,
wrists roped,
and roughly bound.
From a tiny mouth,
and pretty lips,
you utter
not a sound.
I paint with words,
a canvas stretched,
laid bare,
upon the ground.`,
`Her perfume reminded me of freshly picked
flowers and sticky candy floss, mixed with
a gentle hint of debauchery.`,
`There is a certain stillness, when even the gentle flutter of a butterfly's wing feels like a hurricane.
The moment when crashing waves fall asleep, peaceful, lost to the serenity of salty dreams.
When tall trees stand to attention and every leaf pauses, takes a deep breath, and holds it.
It is here, beneath the maddening silence I hear your name.
An echo of you.`,
`Fantasies. Like having your own entertainment channel that
you can cut, edit, and replay-anytime, anywhere.`,
`You have such a pretty mouth.
To feed it only kisses
would be a wasted opportunity.`,
`We kissed beneath the twisted trees,
our lips between the stars,
tiny ripples in a lake,
this love, once lost,
is ours.`,
`Words are powerful things. They can break
hearts and make panties wet.`,
`The more buttons you undo, she said,
the faster I become undone.`,
`Let's continue this conversation in bed, she whispered. My legs
can't wait to hear what your hands have to say.`,
`There comes a moment, hidden beneath the gentle moans escaping your lips, where a wet line is crossed. Transforming the act of touching yourself to a whole different level. It suddenly becomes what it really is. Everything you want it to be. Raw, hardcore, legs apart, masturbation.
And as the intensity of the pleasure increases with each repeated circle, the fantasies start to flow. Sticky and swollen. Stretching your imagination and opening you up to your dirty little secrets-
Pulling your hair and fucking you fast.
A tiny mouth opens . . .
Spasms and shock waves of pleasure explode between your legs, mini aftershocks rippling over your clenched body, as tight fingers pull on a hard nipple.
You lay beneath the messy sheets, quietly exhausted and smiling.`,
`All that you write,
you know
it's not right,
you move me
with written suggestion.
I know it's absurd,
to be undressed by a word,
write me more
write me more-
make me yours.`,
`I love spending rainy afternoons in bed getting wet.`,
`The words you say,
so fancy free,
that fly from lips
from you
to me,
remind me not
of words I've known,
when flowers grew
where weeds have grown.`,
`I love to trace your pretty lips with my fingers,
and imagine them going down on me.`,
`It was a sparkly raindrops kind of morning-little
diamonds falling on leafy green.
Our lips wet, kissing under a tree.`,
`I watched as your busy fingers moved with a calm state of well-practiced precision. The little silver spoon held over a waning candle flame. White chalky dust, turning from a bubbling brown to a clear liquid poison. Drawn carefully through the virgin cigarette filter. Filling a disposable syringe. A poignant metaphor for what was fast becoming your throwaway life.
"Please don't, seriously, I beg you . . ."
She gave me that look. The one that had hooked me all those years ago on that crisp autumn morning. In the forest. Long lashes flickering as her eyes fell into mine. Her reckless body pinned to the soft leafy ground . . .
I watched her plunge the needle between her toes. Her lips let out a silent sigh. Head rolling back. Red hair tumbling over skinny white shoulders. Nipples poking hard against the black singlet. Legs falling apart. Eyelids closing. Body collapsing. A rag doll falling onto a lonely, unmade bed.
It was a very long minute before the words appeared like ghosts, slipping through the trembling gates of a graveyard.
"I know you love her."
"Yes, I do, very much," I cautiously replied.
"I know you love her . . . love her . . . love."
She drifted off into a sleep that danced a dangerous pirouette with death. I took it as my cue to leave. Exit stage right. The curtain had finally fallen on this sad little play.
I did love the girl with the crooked black fringe. Who had found her way through the darkness to discover my broken heart. Her tiny, clever hands, stitching it back together. She was my forever girl. The true love of my life. A soul mate.
Closing the bedroom door, I took one last look behind me and then wham. Like a diamond bullet to the brain it hit me. There was a junkie in the room and it wasn't Sophia.`,
`Red heels
on a pavement,
punctuated
by long legs
striding
toward me.
Your lips
a full stop
on mine.`,
`Your words touch me in a way I find difficult to
describe, she said, although whenever I read
them it feels a lot like foreplay.`,
`Normally I tend to choose my words carefully when it comes to such delicate matters. However, seeing you now, here in the moonlight, all I can think about is pulling your panties down and fucking you with your socks on.`,
`The saddest truth is realizing you have fallen madly in love
with what can never be.`,
`I found you,
hidden by crooked fingers
of gnarly wood
and leafy green,
a pale ghost,
drifting like morning mist,
through haunted trees
and forest birdsong.
You come to me
in waning moonlight,
your story told
on icy skin,
the pages pale,
with purple kisses,
walking barefoot
and breathless,
toward my heart.
You found me,
buried deep
beneath this earthly blanket,
of thorny twigs
and weeping mud,
two lovers torn
now bound together,
in joyful death
we make our bed.`,
`The girl had an impossibly beautiful face, the heady combination of youth and expensive plastic surgery. She smiled as she took my credit card, swiping it with the well-practiced precision of somebody well versed with stealing ridiculous amounts of dollars from well-heeled guests.
"Welcome to the Dakota Hills Hotel. I hope you enjoy your stay with us."
I took my room key, reached for my lone suitcase, and headed for the lift.
"Let me take that for you, sir," said the eager puppy dog bellhop. A hipster-looking dude with a coal black designer beard and swept-back blond hair.
Normally I would have said a polite, "No thank you. I can manage," but I was too tired to argue, sleepwalking through the lobby, looking every bit like a man who has just spent the last 18 hours on an uncomfortable flight from nowhere to somewhere.
A tinny, instrumental version of "Royals" by Lorde played in the ornate mirror-rimmed elevator. I stared at the numbers, transfixed by every digit change, waiting silently for this part of the nightmarish journey to end. Which it suddenly did with an abrupt stop and the two metal doors sliding open with a hushed whisper.
"I can take it from here," I said, reclaiming my suitcase with one hand and handing over a $10 tip with the other.
"Thank you, sir," replied the beaming bellhop, "and if there's anything you need during your stay don't hesitate to ask for me, Gerome . . ." I didn't catch the rest of his sales pitch, saved by the doors as they slid together just as quietly as they had opened.
My suite was the second doorway from the left. Once inside, room key slid into the slot and low lights coming on, an overwhelming feeling of relief swept over me. Kicking off my shoes I made my way through the little mock lounge to the king-sized bed, laid my suitcase on top of it, and walked straight over to the mini bar.
Minutes passed as minutes do, drinking slowly from a heavy glass filled with jangling ice cubes and vodka, hypnotized by the streaky nighttime scene being played outside my window.
Time just seemed to jump-cut like a YouTube clip knocked together by a bunch of stoner art students.
I remember taking the body-numbing hot shower and slipping into the fluffy white robe that was hung next to another matching one on the back of the door. How I made it back to the bed, unpacked my suitcase, and phoned through my late-night room service order was anyone's guess.
BBC world news flickered in the background, a story about a train derailment in Madrid washing over me as the second vodka kicked in.
I must have drifted off because the ringing doorbell woke me like a bucket of cold water thrown over a Saturday night drunk.
Pulling my robe tightly around my naked waist I stumbled toward the door, unlocked the chain, and turned the handle.
Before I even had time to fully open the heavy wooden door, it was pushed from the outside by a long black-stockinged leg, a room service tray held between two white-gloved hands.
The girl flashed a crooked smile and tossed her head back, sending the red ponytail she wore bouncing across her milky white bare shoulders.
"Where would you like this?" she cooed, two emerald green eyes sparkling in my direction. It was a rhetorical question. I watched as she set the tray down on the walnut writing desk and hopped onto the bed.
I knew instantly there was something not quite right about this strange scenario being played out in the dimly lit room. She just didn't belong in this movie. Her ivory cream-colored cutoff top, short cobweb gray skirt, and tattooed arms didn't fit the normal room service uniform script.
"Come up here," she said, patting the spare space next to her on the bed.
"Look, I'm not sure what this is all about but I think there has been some kind of mistake."
A confused and somewhat clumsy cliché retort, but the only one that seemed to make any sense in this moment of fast-unraveling reality.
"Think of me as an adventure," she replied, sliding off her red heels.
I didn't really know what to think as my tired eyes fell softly into hers.
"My name is Lucy. Lucy Lockett. You can call me Arousal. All my special friends do."
"Pleased to meet you, Lucy. Do you work for the hotel?"
"Call me Arousal and no, I don't work for anyone. Now, how about you take off that robe and hop into bed. All this chitchat is getting in the way."
"In the way of what? Listen, I think there has been a serious mix-up and you've got the wrong room. I didn't book a hooker and to be perfectly honest I really think you should leave."
She laughed. Flashing a row of perfectly white teeth. Her mischievous eyes smiling.
"Relax. I don't fuck for money. I fuck for fun, for poetry, for words whispered late at night by strangers."
I felt a curious sense of calm slowly wrapping itself around me like a comfy blanket on a cold winter's morning. A hazy whiteness seemed to fill the hotel room as the walls dissolved away to nothing and I found myself standing naked, my back against a tree in a forest.
Arousal was on her knees, her pretty little mouth sucking my hard cock, eyes looking up at me.
I reached down and took hold of her red ponytail, forcing her head up and down.
My eyes closed as her wet lips worked their magic.
"No, not yet," she said, suddenly stopping and standing up, her lipstick smudged.
She stood before me, bare feet covered by decaying leaves, knees stained by wet mud, breasts bare with dusty pink nipples hard and erect.
Dirty pretty words formed in my head, rearranging themselves into verbal patterns like a kaleidoscope of ever-changing verse.
They tumbled from my lips, glowing golden and bright, forming smoky 3-D sentences that floated up toward the treetops.
Under a pale pink sky
we slept,
our eyes wide open.
Awake inside a dream,
once dreamt and forsaken.
The time that we lost
was not of our making,
like a love quickly taken,
misplaced
and mistaken.
Arousal spun around and around, arms reaching up into the air, eyes searching the sky, seeking the last wisp of fading words as they got swept away by the breeze.
I could feel the familiar tingling between my legs, the unspoken poetry of longing and desire.
The girl with the red ponytail collapsed to her knees again, eyes looking up at me, back arched and white cotton panties begging to be pulled down.
"Fuck me," she cried, a lone tear running down her blushing cheek.
I gripped her panties with one hand and pulled the crotch to one side with the other. My cock could feel the wetness beneath the soft fabric as it rubbed up against her thighs.
"Fuck me like you hate me," she purred, her lips curled up into a teasing pout.
The rain came with a whipped-up fury of dead leaves and swirling wind.
Three black crows exploded into the angry clouds, wings flapping furiously, punctuating the deafening sound of a million heavy raindrops smashing into the forest floor.
All time seemed to slow down and slowly sink like a drowning child in a stormy sea.
I reached for the handle, opened the door, and took the last vodka bottle from the mini bar fridge.
Pouring the contents into the heavy glass tumbler, I caught a quick glimpse of my body reflected in the wardrobe mirror.
A crisscross pattern of bloody scratches stared back.
I could hear the shower running and the echo of a sultry voice singing something sugary and seductive.
Shafts of early morning sun touched the messy sheets that lay strewn across the floor, casting slow-dancing shadows over the unmade bed.
It signaled the end of another night and the start of a new adventure.`,
`To the quiet one,
the coy,
the wallflower.
Her dark circled eyes
buried in a book.
Hard little nipples,
dusty pink,
beneath a tatty
black singlet.
Those restless legs,
sprawled across
a squeaky bed.
Her secrets kept,
like pressed daisies
hidden by
pages read.`,
`Some days we spoke about life, other days, we discussed the
weather-and whenever we laughed, it was the best sex ever.`,
`You tore apart,
my paper heart
with words that I was dreading.
Now all that's left,
of love unsaid,
is dead and made for shredding.
Like cursed confetti,
tossed and thrown,
at a doomed and dismal wedding.`,
`Take nothing for granted. Even a rock will eventually surrender
to the sea and love can slip away like sand through fingers.`,
`It is upon
a pale skin,
I write
these words to you.
A story told
with ticklish pen,
of all that we
must do.
To be in love
with words
my love,
and all
that they depict,
the dirty
pretty things
I wrote,
each little box
we ticked.`,
`I want to feel your fingers unclip my bra, she said, and unravel
the last thread of decency I possess.`,
`I fell in love
with love
it seems,
for what was real
is not.
The lies you spun
when we begun,
you thought
would be forgot.
Time heals all wounds-
you said to me,
well this
I say to you-
The scar I wear,
I cannot bear,
for it is
my heart
you broke
in two.`,
`We found ourselves, as we often did, sprawled out under the covers of our unmade bed. You, lying on your stomach, laptop open, clicking on Hentai. Me, peering over your bare shoulders, touching a nipple, making it hard, like I always do.
I can hear you breathing, the subtle excitement building with each exhale. My hand reaching down, busy fingers pulling your panties off. A little moan escaping from your tiny mouth.
English subtitles play catch up with the singsong Japanese voice-over as an animated girl with wide eyes and ridiculously large tits gets fucked up against a wall in a bathhouse.
Your eyes close for a moment, my wet fingers sliding softly in and out of you.
I slam shut the laptop.
You get up onto your knees, back arched, long black hair slowly falling over your face, my hand pushing your head deep into the pillow.
I get behind you, my cock teasing your pussy and forcing its way in as you bite down on your lip.
We fuck hard and fast. Just how you like it. Your thighs making loud slapping noises against mine.
Suddenly you let out a muffled scream into the pillow, the orgasm catching you by surprise, the spasms gripping my cock tighter as I explode inside you.
We lay on our backs, eyes looking up at the rainbow patterns dancing across the ceiling. Your hand clutching mine.
"Do you want some ice cream?"
I have a habit of asking peculiar questions at times like this.
"Okay," you reply.
You watch as I climb out of bed, tipping the cat off the covers as I reach for my dressing gown.
Before I open the bedroom door, I stop and turn around.
"l love you."
"I love you too," you whisper, flipping open the laptop.
The Hentai clip starts playing again.
A chubby animated man wearing a white towel is peeping through a crack in the window, watching two naked girls on their knees, scrubbing the wooden floors of the bathhouse with wire brushes.
You pause the scene, your smile reflected in the screen.
Waiting for me to return.`,
`I'm the kind of girl who has a restless mind and impatient legs . . .
I watched as her fingers nervously flicked the well-worn elastic of her white cotton panties.
I want you to ruin me.`,
`Every time you take a sip,
your lips wet with wine,
I wish I was that glass.`,
`Every time you open your eyes I fall deeper
in love with the story they tell.`,
`The lazy tide rolled in like a snail smoking weed.
Much to the amusement of the crooked trees that waved a leafy wave and poked fun at the salty breeze that giggled back.
Even the fish, little iridescent rainbows, smiled.
Seduced by a psychedelic sun that teased and tickled its way across the laughing orange carpet that was the sea.
Sparkles.
Little diamond fragments shone from green fingertips.
And still the rain fell.
While she collapsed under the crumpled sheets.
Wet and wetter.
He on his back, exhausted and smiling.
Another afternoon in bed.
Well spent.`,
`There was something quite perverse about my love of crisp, cold days, especially the ones touched by a weak watery warmth that spilled down from skies of winter blue.
Perhaps it was the remoteness of being that appealed to me.
Sitting in an empty park, surrounded by the towering trees, bare and lonely, their leaves long departed and now left decaying on the chilly ground.
Even the odd flap of wings from startled sparrows, darting between bare limbs and twisted branches, did little to interrupt the stillness of this solitary moment.
Where I found myself, as I often did, writing endless poetry in scrawly pencil strokes.
My fingers frozen, as the faint gray words fell upon the pristine pages of a battered leather-bound journal.
Every sentence formed, a furrow plowed across an empty field, where seeds refused to grow.
I remember once, many years ago, finding myself transfixed and strangely hypnotized by the mechanical whirring of an automata.
Two metal monkeys, grimaced faces covered in speckled paint and tuffs of tatty black hair, sitting opposite each other, weary combatants dueling across a tired-looking wooden chessboard.
I watched as their arthritic paws moved the pieces with robotic precision, playing the same game over and over again with identical conclusion.
After every checkmate, they reset the pieces to start playing again, only stopping to be rewound by the turn of an ornate brass key.
A beautiful exercise in futility, repetitive and strangely cathartic.
Like a pencil driven between the blue lines by a driver with no clear direction in mind.
"The more you write, the more you write."
I can't recall who said that to me, but the words stuck. An inky stain, dark black and impossible to remove.
A throaty bark from a panting dog broke the silence.
Its muddy paws kicking up leaves, tail wagging, chasing a faded green tennis ball thrown by a loved-up couple, wearing his and hers matching blue anoraks.
I watched them walk away, a trail of faint laughter clinging to a tangled thread of wispy breeze. A distant memory left behind with every step and fast unraveling.
A last kiss stolen from Lucy's tear-stained lips. Salty and unforgiving.
Her hand slowly slipping away from mine as we sat on this very bench.
"I love you, but, I just can't live with you anymore," the words she wrote with a voice frail and broken.
A miserable ending to our magnificent love story.
One that my pencil still refuses to write to this day.`,
`May my last breath,
be it faint,
and whisper thin,
meet death quietly.
A final kiss,
buried gently,
within the warmth,
of the only lips,
I ever lived,
to truly love.`,
`She had a mind like a box of fireworks and hands
that played recklessly with matches.`,
`He floated upon a gentle sea of rippling green.
Where little yellow butterflies danced drunk pirouettes on the windy stage.
Reading the words written by fluffy white poets who wrote ever-changing prose across an endless blue page.
"Apples are funny things," he said. "You can never be sure of what you are getting until you take that first bite."
His hand reaches slowly for the half-empty vodka bottle.
"This afternoon I discovered an apple so wonderfully perfect, I wouldn't be surprised if it came from the outstretched hand of a wicked old witch."
She pulled up her white cotton panties, brushing an ant from a grass-stained knee.
"I've been called many things before but never an apple," she laughed.`,
`We made love on stormy summer nights.
Our kisses wet and furious like rain running wild across the naked ground.
Her gentle moans lost in the rumble of thunder.`,
`The most beautiful
sound in the world to me
is not forest birdsong
or babbling brooks
or even the ringing
of church bells.
It's hearing you
whisper "I love you"
over and over again.`,
`Yellow taxi tires screech to a sudden stop. A door slams shut. Steps stirring up swirling pavement puddles. Tripping over rusty tin cans in the cobblestone lane.
Anticipation finally arrives in the shape of a corner shop.
Rain-streaked heart-shaped windows. A seductive wink from a sultry flashing neon sign. Lollipops, meticulously written in silver scripted letterpressed letters. A place where generous sprinklings of sugary sex are swapped for a handful of crumpled dollar bills.
A promise becomes permission.
I walk you slowly through the red leather door. Little kitten heels and long white socks. A cotton candy smile. Nipples fighting hard against the tight tunic top that I bought you last summer. A ridiculously short gray pleated woolen skirt.
Tired candles yawn. Casting cryptic shadows across the pink and cream striped hallway, where glory holes wait.
You kneel down.
I push the shiny black token into the slot.
You look up at me. Eyes begging softly.
I lean down and quietly whisper words, best left unsaid.
A thick hard cock suddenly appears from a hole in the wall. Beautifully gift-wrapped in black cellophane and a red velvet ribbon bow.
Furtive fingers reaching out. Silently untying.
As tearing turns to torn, a tiny mouth opens. I gently lift up your skirt from behind. A little wet patch appears on your pretty panties. I feel myself harden. Watching your hungry lips devour and swallow.
Your birthday present.`,
`It has been said that to wear a scarlet dress in a
cemetery can attract the spirit of a lover long dead.
If you were taken from me,
from this place I call our world,
I would not cry,
or even sigh,
wring my hands,
or wonder why.
Instead you'd find me waiting,
ever by your side,
every single second,
this rule I do abide.
Whatever did this girl possess?
The question they will pose,
to make her wear the scarlet dress
and hold a ruby rose.
If you were given to me,
from this place I call your heart,
I would not cry,
or even sigh,
wring my hands,
or wonder why.`,
`I never truly believed in fate until your lips met mine
and convinced me otherwise.`,
`I cannot sleep,
I cannot cry,
I cannot even wonder why.
You broke my heart,
will I be missed?
Red ribbons wrapped
around my wrist.`,
`Sometimes you make me feel like a clock perched on a dusty shelf, she said. Counting down the hours, the minutes and seconds until we meet again.
And when we do, the hands become my legs.
Forever stuck on 4:40 p.m.`,
`Oh to be smitten,
tangled
by silly cuteness,
like a ball of red wool,
chased by a kitten.
My lemon meringue pie,
sugary sweet,
with a trace
of playful sour.
Let's catch
our summer butterflies,
blue skies,
radiant
above.
Two foolish fools
falling-
in love,
with love.`,
`I am afraid of the dark, she said.
I am your torch, he replied.`,
`Beneath a canopy of fluttering green we lay, eyes closed, backs pressing against the forest floor of fallen leaves and crooked twigs. A gentle wind whispered sweet nothings, a voice laced
with shrill birdsong and creaking branches.
I could hear you breathing, your hand entwined in mine. The memory of your scent still wet upon my lips.
"Close those beautiful eyes and lift up your skirt ever so slowly. Show me where you want to be touched."
It almost seemed a lifetime ago when our eyes first met.
Sipping from champagne glasses and staring across a freshly cut lawn of emerald green littered with well-heeled drunks and lipstick-stained cigarette butts.
I watched as you floated toward me like a lost feather in a careless breeze.
A black bra strap fallen from a milky white shoulder.
Lips painted crimson.
Afternoon sunshine curled up on a bed of flowing black hair.
Your hand silently taking mine.
Leading me toward the forest with barely whispered words.
"Make me wet. Make me moan. Make me yours."
I heard the rustle of autumn leaves.
My eyes opened to a setting sun through the forest canopy.
Turning my head I could see you standing.
Adjusting the little blue cotton pleated skirt.
One white sock missing.
Knees dirty.
"I find the idea of getting down on my knees terribly exciting," she said. "Now, make me beg for it."
I lit a cigarette while my mind drifted between the now and then.
The blue smoke forming a question mark, punctuating the crisp afternoon air.
"I don't even know your name," I said.
"Does it really matter," you replied, placing the crumpled panties into your black leather handbag.`,
`Inside forest. On a muddy track that runs through it. One slip and you're falling into the gully. Silence punctuated by birdsong. Green everywhere. We should come and explore in the morning. We will have to be careful. Cover your mouth as you orgasm. Sound travels here.`,
`She was the kind of girl
who loved to stretch out
under the sheets,
eating chocolate,
reading books,
and fucking on
rainy afternoons.`,
`Suddenly I landed.
The wind knocked out of me.
Heavy gasps.
Breathing in slowly.
Fingers checking.
Nothing broken.
Eyes closing.
You smiling.
Me realizing.
How hard I have fallen-
in love.`,
`It cannot be-
she said to me,
the end
is not my making.
To keep apart,
two lovers hearts,
is another's undertaking.
This might be true-
I said to you,
but it is they
who are mistaken.
For where there's a sun
you'll find a moon,
and neither
can be forsaken.`,
`Outside, the snow continued to fall, whipped up by a swirling vicious wind that knocked on the frosty windows and rattled the old wooden door.
Inside the tiny stone cottage, it was a different story.
Flickering flames from a glowing fire cast leaping shadows, which danced like drunk ballerinas across the cobwebbed walls.
Her hand reached for the vodka bottle.
Mine stroked a thigh which begged to be touched, caressed, and kissed.
"I'm feeling tipsy," she laughed, filling her glass to the brim, the contents overflowing, forming a small puddle that quickly soaked into the wine-stained rug.
"Would you like to hear a story?"
"Of course," she replied, pushing my hand under her skirt.
"Well, once upon a time, when I was living in Berlin . . ."
"Stop right there," she said. "I've heard this one. Remember? The gypsy girl who stole your heart and keeps it in a golden cage. You always repeat yourself when you're drunk."
She was right. I had told her the story, as I had the many others who had drifted into my life and melted away, like delicate snowflakes captured by a winter sun.
"Here, drink this and forget about it. I don't care if you can't love me. I honestly don't."
I took the bottle from her outstretched hand and swallowed two generous swigs, a warm river running down my throat.
Emily smiled and stood up, her gorgeous green eyes twinkling in the darkness.
"You know what I want? More than anything right now?" she said, hitching up her skirt to reveal the black lace panties with a pretty red bow. "I want you to fuck me like you fucked that gypsy girl."
I put the bottle down and pointed to the bed that sat waiting in the corner of the room.
"Why do we need a bed when there's a perfectly good table right here?"
I watched as she climbed onto it, kicking a chair over with a bare foot as she turned over, pressing her back down on the hard wood, legs slowly spreading wider.
"It's time you wrote a new story, one I haven't heard," she whispered.`,
`She was a curious girl, a wanderer, who spent her summers
chasing fluttering pieces of prose and eating strawberries.`,
`To slap you,
is to touch you.
Scream for mercy.
Beg for more.
To bite you,
is to kiss you.
Tied and tethered,
on the floor.
To loathe you,
is to love you.
Pretty princess.
Dirty whore.`,
`When you're in love, truly in love, you never have to question it.`,
`Sticky fingers
on sugary lips;
a criminal returns
to the scene
of a crime.
A wry smile,
betrays her innocence;
a signed confession
witnessed by
blushing cheeks
and auburn hair.
Naked guilt,
a punishment dealt;
over a wooden table,
where a jam doughnut
is noticeably absent.`,
`Your scream
startled birds,
rising up from
naked trees,
laid bare
by winter's breath.
Little clouds
of spoken mist,
from the lips
of lovers lost,
fade to nothing.
Pretty knees
turn to icy blue,
on frozen sheets
of brilliant white,
in a bed
of falling snow,
stained red.`,
`Some nights I close my eyes and imagine feeling your lips on mine, your whispered words slowly pushing my legs apart.`,
`Think of me as an uncharted map. I want your hands to explore every single city, town, and village.`,
`Love came
as it often does,
all smiles
and fragrant flowers,
but when it left
it left behind,
the fallen petals
of what was
ours.`,
`Yes, I dream of many things, she said, and the thought of
your hand between my legs is just one of them.
Now shut up and kiss me.`,
`I love,
how you like
to tease.
Slowly crawling,
while your legs
do the talking,
with knees
that blush,
on wooden floors.
Dropping a pencil,
and picking it up.`,
`I know I shouldn't be telling you this, she said, but I have
an overwhelming urge to fuck you-right here, right now.`,
`Would you prefer chocolate or strawberry ice cream?
I'm surprised I even have a choice, she replied.
You don't-
Now close those eyes and open your pretty mouth.`,
`Sometimes if
I stop
to think,
this life
we share
could drown
and sink,
beneath
the waves-
I contemplate,
about the love
we do
create.`,
`May you fall asleep in the arms of a dream, so beautiful,
you'll wake up crying.`,
`It wasn't right,
you know it's wrong,
the heart you took,
did not belong.
But now it's gone,
it's yours to keep,
for another's loss,
is theirs to weep.`,
`She was obsessed with the color red,
this dangerous girl with scarlet lips.
Her reckless kisses written in blood
upon a page I could not turn.`,
`Magic tumbled from her pretty lips and when she spoke the
language of the universe-the stars sighed in unison.`,
`Such a gorgeous tangle
your legs in mine
a fantasy is sold.
Our outstretched arms
explore the charms
of desire and sex
well told.
We live this dream
of moans and screams,
a life in bed
all spent.`,
`She wore the scent
of early spring
on her delicate neck
and every kiss I stole
tasted of bright yellow flowers
and buzzing bees.`,
`I am alone,
love passes by.
Crying tears,
I wonder why-
I cannot find
what others found.`,
`The first kiss is the last to be forgotten.`,
`I fell into a sea of tears
and sank beneath its waves,
each breath I lost,
became the cost,
I paid for wasted years.
To sink or swim
a question posed,
an answer lost within,
a sorrow kept,
drowned by regret,
I cry for you again.`,
`I never understood desire
until I felt your hands
around my throat.`,
`I love thinking about your mouth on my nipples and your hand up my skirt, she said, in fact the very suggestion of you makes me want to pull my panties down.`,
`I lit
this fire,
burning fierce,
and all-consuming.
My desperate tears,
useless,
against flames that leap,
turning
my breaking heart
to blackened cinders.`,
`Grab my hair and bring me to my knees.
Smudge my lipstick and ruin my pretty lips.`,
`I watch you write,
my love, my life,
my start of everything.
Each little sigh,
a pen run dry,
another painful page
begins.
Your fingers bleed,
I do concede,
for a sentence
of your making.
To which you say,
on sunshine days,
it is for words
my heart is breaking.`,
`Do you know what a palindrome is, madam?`,
`What could be
a love so fierce,
in your hands
so gently trimmed.
Each little cut
you take with caution,
a love suspended
but never grown.`,
`Put your hands on my knees, she said, and think of me as a book you've been dying to read.`,
`I know it's wrong,
but the very thought
of your hands,
reaching up under
my skirt,
and touching me,
makes me blush
in all the right places.`,
`To read in books
of love well told,
leaves nothing
in the meaning.
For the love
we have
is barely held,
between pages
of our reading.`,
`True love is elusive, she said. Sometimes I think it's as rare as a red moon on a cloudless night.`,
`Petals unfurl
from a delicate flower,
closer to picked
with each
passing hour,
losing the I
and gaining
an our.`,
`I am hypnotized.
Sleepwalking to the rhythm of your words,
Never wishing to wake-`,
`The kind of love letters I write are the ones
you read in bed, stretched out under the sheets
with one hand between your legs.`,
`She turns her mind
to countless things,
then back again
where it begins.
This restless urge,
and all it brings,
to be someone-
to do something.`,
`Her eyes were beautifully gift-wrapped;
long black lashes of velvet ribbon-
and every time she opened them,
it felt like Christmas.`,
`Now's not the time to be poetic, she said. Just pull my panties down and do me up against this tree.`,
`I could taste
the sting of whiskey
on your lips,
a final kiss,
before we said
our last good-bye,
without a word
being said.`]
